# Superstore Analysis - Python Project

Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail Superstore dataset to uncover business insights related to sales, profit, customer segments, product categories, and regional performance.

The objective is to analyze historical sales data and identify trends, high-performing areas, loss-making products, and growth opportunities to support data-driven business decisions.

🎯 Problem Statement
